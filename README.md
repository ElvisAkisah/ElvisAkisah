# Hi, I'm Elvis Akisah Abanke üëã

I am a Data Scientist with a passion for uncovering insights and solving complex problems through data. I am currently leveraging my 17-year background as a Head of Mathematics to bring a unique perspective of leadership, logic, and mentorship to the tech world.

My transition into data science is powered by a recently completed, intensive **10-month Data Science program at TripleTen** and my ongoing pursuit of a **Master of Data Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology**. I am driven by curiosity and a desire to build effective, data-driven solutions.
